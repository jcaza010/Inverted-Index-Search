# Inverted Index + Search Program 
### CS course project

This program takes a file path to a folder containing data after a successful web crawl and creates an inverted index of every token contained in the data. It creates additional files in addition to the inverted index file to try and optimize the search program, such as an index for the index. You can then search the index with any query and it will return the most relevant links, as well as the response time to measure optimization.

## To use:

Launch the inverted index program and provide a file path that contains multiple folders containing json files of crawled websites. After that program has finished running and the desired files are created. Run the search program and enter any query you wish to search for, or press 'q' to quit.

The 'index_info' folder contains an example of what the files created should look like after the inverted index program has finished running.
